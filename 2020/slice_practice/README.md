Hashcode 2020 practice problem

- Run `python <path_to_script.py></path_to_script.py> <path_to_input_file.in> <path_to_output_file.out>`
- Best thus far in this problem was `slice3.py`. The best solution we had was [Isaac's](https://github.com/cmplx-xyttmt/hashcode2020/blob/master/src/slice/slice.py).
